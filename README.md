Technical assignment for a Frontend developer position
Create a simple Vue.js application that would contain three pages.
• The first page - would contain a list of all available images from the given API( added below). Each image could be identified by its name.
It is up to you how you would like to style that list. It can be something simple, carousel, grid, etc. We are curious about your creativity.
• The second page - would be a list of Favorite Views. From the given API, you can find the necessary data to display this list.
• Third page - clicking on selected images from the favorite list or a simple list would redirect to a full- screen image(third page). That page should contain the name of the image and button to come back to the list(previous page).
As mentioned below, there are no set rules for styling here, so create it the way that you like it.
Important:
1. Application should be created in Vue.js
2. Application should not contain jQuery or Bootstrap(or similar)
3. Consider responsiveness
4. Use localhost:4200 to avoid CORS issues
